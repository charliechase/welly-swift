#About this project

**This is a simple iOS application written in Swift that we used to run an introductory iOS development course [Welly Swift](http://swift.hackpack.co.nz/)**

Please feel free to fork this repository and use it as a template to create your own iOS development course to run in your local community.

In time we plan to store all the resources that we created when desiging the course, here in this repository.

## A quick rundown

* Master contains the completed application. This should serve as a great starting point to look through and decide if you would like to use this template.

* course/begin contains an empty application with the file structure we used for the course. This is what we installed on the desktops of the students so they could get started straight away.

* We plan to add extra curricular activites to this course. They will all be stored in branches off master named extra/**
